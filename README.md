# AutoClicker

The simplest (and unoptimized) console-based left mouse button autoclicker with a customizable toggle key, end key, and delay time [ms].

The functionality is simple: just run the program and toggle the clicker with the toggle key ('.' by default). Use the end key ('`' by default) to stop the program. The default delay between clicks is 10 milliseconds. The autoclicker works in the background or when minimized, so you don't need to keep it as the active window.

Customization is done by modifying the AutoClicker.cpp file; look for the declarations of toggleKey, endKey, and delayTime.
